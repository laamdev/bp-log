# Blood pressure guidelines

Blood pressure recommendations may vary slightly between different guidelines and healthcare organizations, but generally, the following categories are used to describe blood pressure levels in adults:

1. Normal Blood Pressure:

   - Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP): Less than 120 mm Hg
   - Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP): Less than 80 mm Hg

2. Elevated Blood Pressure:

   - SBP: 120-129 mm Hg
   - DBP: Less than 80 mm Hg

3. Hypertension Stage 1:

   - SBP: 130-139 mm Hg
   - DBP: 80-89 mm Hg

4. Hypertension Stage 2:

   - SBP: 140 mm Hg or higher
   - DBP: 90 mm Hg or higher

5. Hypertensive Crisis (Emergency):
   - SBP: Higher than 180 mm Hg
   - DBP: Higher than 120 mm Hg

It's important to note that the definition of hypertension (high blood pressure) changed with updated guidelines. Hypertension Stage 1 was introduced as a category in recognition of the health risks associated with even mildly elevated blood pressure. The old definition of hypertension used to start at 140/90 mm Hg, but now, it starts at 130/80 mm Hg.

Blood pressure readings can vary throughout the day, and a single reading may not provide a complete picture of an individual's blood pressure. Healthcare professionals often recommend multiple readings on different occasions to diagnose hypertension accurately. Lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes, exercise, and medication, may be prescribed based on the severity of hypertension.

It's essential for individuals to have regular blood pressure check-ups and consult with a healthcare provider to determine their optimal target blood pressure, as individual circumstances can influence the recommended values. Hypertension, if left unmanaged, can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and other health complications.
