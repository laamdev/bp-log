# How to measure your blood pressure

Measuring blood pressure is a straightforward procedure that can be done at home with a home blood pressure monitor (sphygmomanometer) or by a healthcare professional. Blood pressure is typically expressed as two numbers, such as 120/80 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury). The two numbers represent different aspects of blood pressure:

1. Systolic Pressure (the top number): This is the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats and pumps blood into the circulatory system.

2. Diastolic Pressure (the bottom number): This is the pressure in your arteries when your heart is at rest between beats.

Here are the steps to measure blood pressure:

**Using a Home Blood Pressure Monitor:**

1. **Choose the right monitor:** There are two main types of home blood pressure monitors: digital (automatic) and manual (aneroid) monitors. Digital monitors are easier to use for most people.

2. **Prepare yourself:** It's essential to be in the right state for an accurate reading. Make sure you have not consumed caffeine, exercised, or smoked in the 30 minutes before the measurement. Sit quietly and relax for 5-10 minutes.

3. **Prepare the cuff:** Put the cuff around your upper arm. The bottom edge of the cuff should be about an inch above your elbow. Ensure that the cuff fits snugly but not too tight.

4. **Position yourself:** Sit in a comfortable chair with your back straight and your feet flat on the floor. Rest your arm on a table or armrest so that it is at the same level as your heart.

5. **Start the monitor:** If using a digital monitor, press the start button. The cuff will inflate automatically. If using a manual monitor, inflate the cuff using the provided bulb until it is snug but not overly tight.

6. **Read the measurement:** As the cuff deflates, the monitor will display your systolic and diastolic pressures. Record these numbers.

7. **Repeat if necessary:** For the most accurate reading, it's recommended to take three measurements, waiting 1-2 minutes between each reading. Use the average of these readings as your blood pressure.

**When working with a healthcare professional:**

If a healthcare professional is measuring your blood pressure, they will follow a similar process but may use a different type of blood pressure monitor and take the reading in a clinical setting. They will usually take multiple readings to ensure accuracy.

Keep a record of your blood pressure measurements and share them with your healthcare provider during check-ups. Consistent monitoring of blood pressure is crucial for managing and understanding your cardiovascular health.

If you ever have concerns about your blood pressure or need assistance with monitoring, consult with a healthcare professional for guidance and support.
